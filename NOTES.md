# REACT/REDUX COURSE

## Section 4: Putting Redux to Practice

#### Lesson 39

### Reducers

> A Reducer is a _function_ that returns a piece of the application sate.

Because there are many pieces of state, there can be many reducers.

So in book application diagram there are two pieces of state:

1. List of books
2. Currently selected book

There are two reducers, each responsible for producing one of these.

```
// Application State - Generated by reducers
{
  books: [ { title: 'Harry Potter'}, {title:'Javascript"}],  
  activeBook: { title: 'Javascript: The Good Parts" }
}
```
In this example there is a _Books_ Reducer and an _ActiveBook_ Reducer, each producing a separate piece of state.

**NOTE**: Keys can be whatever we want, the Reducer is only convinced with the _value_ of state.

>To use a Reducer:
>1. Create the Reducer
>2. Wire it into the application

We did step 1 in `src/reducers/reducer_books` and step 2 in `src/reducers/index.js` by modifying `rootReducer` (this will be explored later). Note that we did not name the component in the file, and instead did `export default` so the consuming file (`index`) could name the component as it pleases.

#### Lesson 40

When we pass the object to `combineReducers` we tell Redux how to create our application state. At the early point, our app has a single piece of state called `books` where the value is whatever is returned from the `BooksReducer` function.

Connecting React and Redux is done with a library called _`ReactRedux`_. It allows us to define a component as a `Container` instead of a `Component`. 

> ### ReactRedux:
> A `Container` is a React component that has a _direct connection to the state_ managed by Redux.

But... which components are promoted to Containers, and which are left as regular React Components?
